# SEM Setup
1. Create an EC2 instance (Amazon Linux)
2. SSH into the instance
3. Create a directory called "experiment_1"
4. Navigate to the new directory
5. Run the following command:
```
curl -O https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/Misc_pollen.jpg
```

The EC2 instance is now ready to be used as a mock SEM with one image of cells.
